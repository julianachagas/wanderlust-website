# Wanderlust Website ✈️

This project is a website of a fictional travel agency called Wanderlust. It was developed to practice SASS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript.

The website consists of the main page (home) and four subpages: destination, plans, contact, and subscribe. The navigation and footer are present on all the website pages.

- Homepage: four main sections: hero, benefits, quote, and frequently asked questions (FAQ);

- Destination: image grid and a table with the upcoming events;

- Plans: subscription plans offered by the travel agency;

- Contact: contact form, embed Google Maps, contact details (email, phone, and social media links), and FAQ;

- Subscribe: payment form with two payment methods options: credit card and bank transfer;

Bootstrap's source Saas files were used to customize the project: to override color variables' default values and add new colors to the `$theme-colors` map. Webpack was used to bundle Sass and JavaScript.
